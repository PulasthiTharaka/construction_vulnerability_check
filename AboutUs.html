                                    a vision to become a model construction company in the region.In the early 1990s, we
                                    seized the opportunity
                                    to enter the industry, filling the void created by the high demand for construction
                                    activities resulting from the open economy pursued by the government of the 1990s.
                                    We had the opportunity
                                    to work alongside some of the leading construction companies of the world, helping
                                    us to gain valuable exposure and acquire construction managerial skills which were
                                    utilized for the benefit
                                    of the domestic construction industry. The company acquired the plant and machinery
                                    required for major construction work and successfully built a dynamic and dedicated
                                    team armed with the
                                    necessary knowledge and experience which can be considered its vital strength. It is
                                    this capacity and stength which enabled it to secure some of the most prestigious
                                    construction projects.
                                    We were also involved in our first marine work in the Colombo Heritage Bistro
                                    project and work in the Magampura Runway Project."
